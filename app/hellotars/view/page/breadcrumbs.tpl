  <p class="lead">Breadcrumbs in MVC-X are automatically generated. You simply have to put
  <code>&#91;widget:breadcrumb&#93;</code> anywhere in the template files and you will get a beautiful, fully functional, breadcrumb.</p>
  <p>If you like to style it, you can just override its classes with CSS, or create your own widget/breadcrumb.tpl and edit its HTML.</p>
